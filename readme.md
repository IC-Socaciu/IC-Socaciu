# Welcome to my very first repository! ðŸ™ƒ

Although I have graduated **Linguistics**, most of my jobs happened to challenge me with more technical aspects and expose me to different angles of the ever-growing and ever-learning computer world. In most of my work experiences I have worked as a Customer Support or Help Desk Agent and there is always more to learn and more to improve...

...which is what brought me [here](https://www.neuefische.de/bootcamp/web-development) today!

First day is always difficult and, as in any stressful situation in life, I am trying to tackle this *new challenge* with the following approach:

Outside work and Bootcamp, I am interested in numerous things (there is always something new to do or learn):

1. music is my passion
2. indie horror games both playing and watching and hopefully soon, also making 
3. anything outdoors especially mountains and LONG walks
4. general horror movie buff and brushing up on my overall movie knowledge 

I am looking forward to being part of this team and I wish everyone a great start!
