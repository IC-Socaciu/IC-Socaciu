# Ioana-Cristina Socaciu

**Novice Frontend Developer**

As a support professional transitioning into web development, I possess unique insights into customers
and their pain points. I am looking to expand my knowledge in coding responsive websites and mobile-
first applications and efficiently design and develop web solutions that are agile, user-friendly, and visual-
ly appealing. As an articulate, mature, positive and hardworking team member, I always achieve the high-
est standard possible, at any given task. My excellent communication skills, empathic listening, coupled
with the ability to work comfortably at all levels empower me to work in fast-paced multicultural envi-
ronments. Always enjoying learning new things I am a vigilant team player.

...which is what brought me  today!
