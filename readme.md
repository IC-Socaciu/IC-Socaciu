# Ioana-Cristina Socaciu

**Novice Frontend Developer**

Although I have graduated **Linguistics**, most of my jobs happened to challenge me with more technical aspects and expose me to different angles of the ever-growing and ever-learning computer world. In most of my work experiences I have worked as a Customer Support or Help Desk Agent and there is always more to learn and more to improve...

...which is what brought me [here](https://www.neuefische.de/bootcamp/web-development) today!
